### Moñeco's Adventure

This first project is about creating an Arcade Game in Unity, here is the documentation about the process, results and code used during the development.

1.) Creating a character sprite for the player. The main character is Moñeco, a basic 2D Sprite in charge of collecting Star items and avoiding the Birds.

2.) Adding ground and background. I created several sprites for the ground, the grass and the background loop. This way the camera stays with the player while the background makes the visual effect of movement in a constant loop.

3.) Creating the player movement and jump as the basic character controllers. Player is allowed to move the character with A and D, and jump by pressing Spacebar. Also, I added a double jump feature that allows the player to double jump if the character is not on the ground. Here's the example and portion of the code.

4.) Adding a Bird spawner. For the enemies I created an item spawner that will drop the birds sprites in three different locations in the *y*
